# 2. Video Deepfake Generation Activity

In this activity, you will make use of (Faceswap)[https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap] to generate the fakes. As this open source generator requires time and effort to train the model to perform the swap, we've provided you with a pretained model for 2 Singapore Ministers - Lawrence Wong and Chan Chun Sing. 

Task:
- Use the YouTube Downloader script that you have cloned in Activity 1 to download videos of DPM Lawrence Wong and Min Chan Chun Sing by preparing the youtube links, start/end times of video in a txt file.
- Videos that you select should only consist of their face in the frame, as Faceswap can only perform the swap on 1 person's face in every frame. If your video contains other individuals in the scene, you may use video cropping tools (e.g. Clideo) to crop the video to contain only that 1 individual. This should be done after you have used the script above to download the video.
- Follow instructions in the word document to download required libraries, pretrained models and further instructions on how to perform the face swap. 

The 2 pretrained models can also be accesssed (here)[https://hometeamsnt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ong_si_ci_hometeamsnt_onmicrosoft_com/EsvdDbQwdCREoL-Bx2YCFSEBrDZ5b_FK4-ayU6wwE9tNbw?e=hT18dO].
